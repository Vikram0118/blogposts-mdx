<h4>Yeah! You read that right.</h4>
I am thrilled to share the journey of creating a blazingly fast website using Next.js. From optimizing performance to leveraging the most advanced features of Next.js, this post will unveil the secrets behind achieving an impressive load time of just 0.3 seconds.

<h4>Why care about Performance ? </h4>
It's 2024 and developing a website is no longer just writing HTML, CSS and JS. Speed and Performance really do matter.

As witnessed in the relentless releases of JavaScript frameworks in 2022 and 2023, 2024 is poised to witness a different kind of competition - a war of speed and performance.  As developers, we find ourselves not just coding for functionality but also optimizing for speed.

<h4>How to Optimize Performance ? </h4>
There are hundreds of best practices, that we can apply to our project but will that really help us increse performnace ? `No` . Optimizing performnace is not another good practice that we can adapt to our workflow. A good workflow and the best methadologyy give optimized performance as a result. Few thing that we have to employ while developing application are `Prefecthing`, `Incremental Rendering`, `Search Engine Optimization` and `Handling the initial page load` . 

Google introducted [`Web Vitals`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals) in 2020. Web Vitals is a set of metrics that measure real-world user experience for loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of the page.

The core Web Vitals are :
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - Loading
- First Input Delay (FID) - Interaction
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - Visual Stability

[Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the user first navigated to the page. To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have Largest Contentful Paint of 2.5 seconds or less. 

In addition to LCP we also have to consider about [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/articles/fcp). The First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric measures the time from when the user first navigated to the page to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen.To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Contentful Paint of 1.8 seconds or less.

[The First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/articles/fid) metric helps measure your user's first impression of your site's interactivity and responsiveness. FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (that is, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction. To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Input Delay of 100 milliseconds or less.

[The Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/articles/cls) metric helps you address this problem by measuring how often it's occurring for real users. CLS is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of a page. To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or less. 

It is very curcial that we developers achieve good Web Vitals for success with Search and to ensure a great user experience generally. Yes, depending on these metrics the website that performance the best will be displaed first in the search results.

<h4>How i made my blog wesbite load in 0.4 seconds ?</h4>

The answer is `I used Next.js`

I used the most advanced features of `Next.js 14` such as ` Server Side Rendering (SSR)`, `Static Site Generation(SSG)` , ` Incremental Static Regeneration(ISR)` , `Client Side Rendering (CSR)` , `Server Actions` and `Image Optimization` .

`Server Side Rendering (SSR)` uses the server resources. The initial HTML for the page is prerendered from the server, followed by "hydrating" the page in the browser (making it interactive). This allows us to send less JavaScript to the client, while maintaining the rendered HTML from the server. 

`Static Site Generation(SSG)` is a technique in which we pre-render a page at build time. We fetch data from an external API or directly from a database, and pass this data down to the entire page as it's being generated during the build. Pages built with SSG can also be cached via CDN unlike pages built using SSR. So response time is significantly low compared to SSR. Gives better performance and SEO score.

All the pages in this wesbite are SSG pages, which mean all these pages are prerendered and ready to server. That's why you experience almost no lag while moving across pages.

`Incremental Static Regeneration(ISR)` is an awesome technique introduced by Next.js to tackle stale or outdated pages problems in Static Site Generation. It allows us to revalidate our application without rebuilding the whole app. Thre are two types of revalidation `Time-based revalidation` and `On-demand revalidation` . 

Time based revalidation automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical. On-demand revalidation is manually revalidate data based on an event. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible. 

`Server Action` are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be used in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications. So now you can feel where we are heading to, we try do almost all work in server using server action. The best example would be form validation. 

Next.js offers a Image component which is a extension of the standard HTML. This Image component is well optimised and better performance and uses less bandwidth.

And this is how i made my blog website load in 0.4 seconds. Using all the modern advancements offered by Next.js 

<h4>My Performance metrix</h4>

I have done testing in [GT metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/blog-vikramp.vercel.app/m992KuIl/) and Google Lighthouse.

Performance ans Structure - `100 %` . 

> There are no silver bullets to Web performance. Simple static pages benefit being server-rendered with minimal Javascript. 

LCB: 285 ms. How i got such a score ? I didn't use Google font import in my CSS file. I used font from `next/font/google`. So that way, I m avoiding the delay from Google's response and I [pre build my pages with the font](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) I want.

CLS: 0 (Perfect)

`Performance - 100 %` 

Next.js allows me to generate Meta data for all the pages and maximizes SEO.


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

In conslusion, performance really matters.

As I m writing this article, Next.js is being updated under the hood and new features and advancements are getting released every single day. I will keep this website as my test bench and experiment all the new features. I also continue to write more articles like this about the advancements in web development.
