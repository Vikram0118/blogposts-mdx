## 2. Understand the settings 

You pass in your content to the `readingDuration` function this package provides, but there are some optional settings, too. You can set the `wordsPerMinute` (defaults to 200), and if you want, you can set the returned value to include an emoji (which is an hourglass ‚è≥). 

```tsx
import readingDuration from 'reading-duration'

const readingTime = readingDuration(rawMDXContent, {
  wordsPerMinute: 100, 
  emoji: false,
})
```

## 3. Add reading-duration to Your Next.js Blog

I store my MDX blog article files on GitHub and fetch them as my Next.js blog builds static pages. Below is an abbreviated version of what is happening in my code: 

```tsx
export async function getPostByName(fileName: string) {
    const res = await fetch(`my-github-url/${fileName}`)

    const rawMDX = await res.text()

    const duration = readingDuration(rawMDX, {
        emoji: false,
    })
}
```
I save the above `duration` value with the other `front matter` for the blog post. You can see I went with the default `wordsPerMinute` and declined the default emoji. When I use the duration value, I use an open book üìñ emoji instead.

You can see this value on [my blog homepage](https://www.davegray.codes/) for each article and near the top of each blog article page, too.
